# House_Data_Final_Project
This is my replication package for my STA 215 final project. I analyzed data on the U.S. House of Representatives using various statistics. I focused my analysis on gender, view on abortion, age, and years in office.

# Instructions
To access and utilize the script, open the "STA215-KOLODIY.R" file, which contains the code for my project. To access the dataset, open the "raw_data.csv" file.

# Operationalization
To operationalize gender, Representatives were classified as either "Man or "Woman" based on self-identifying factors. The category of "Other" was initially created for inclusivity, but no current Representative fell into that category.

Abortion view was operationalized as a binary variable with 0 not supporting legalized abortion and 1 supporting legalized abortion. The data was obtained through Planned Parenthood's Congressional Scorecard.

Age was operationalized as their age in numeric form, with data obtained from public records.

Years in office was also operationalized in numeric form, with data obtained directly from the House of Representatives website.

Voting record was operationalized as percentage of votes they participated in, in numerical form.
